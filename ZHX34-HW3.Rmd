```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TwitterData <- read.csv("/Users/xjzayd/Desktop/university/2019\ Fall/STAT\ 1261/Homeworks/HW3/mtmv_data_10_12.csv")
plot <- ggplot(data = TwitterData, mapping = aes (x = mshare, y = vote_share)) 
plot <- plot + geom_point()
plot + labs(title = "the scatter plot for vote_share & mshare")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_with_lm <- plot + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
plot_with_lm + labs(title = "the scatterplot for vote_share & mashare with linear regression line")
```

Description of the graph: 
The graph describes the relationship between the vote_share and mshare. As can be detected from the graph, there exists a positve non-linear relationship of these two variables. The linear regression line indicates the more mshare will derive more vote_share.

# Exercises D.5 D.7 D.10

## Exercise D.5
```{r echo = FALSE}
n <- 679
```
The data set has n = `r n` obervations.   

Explanation: 
`echo` means display code in output document (default = TRUE). However, the author uses `echo = FALSE` in this code chunck. It means do not display code in output document. The variable `n` has been assigned `679` into. Therefore, when we call `n = r n`. It will trace the code code chunk r, and grab the value stored in variable n. Therefore, it will display `n = `r n``. 

## Exercise D.7
```{r warning = TRUE}
sqrt(-1)
```


```{r warning = FALSE}
sqrt(-1)
```

Explanation: 
`warning` means display code warning in documentation (default = TRUE). `warning = FALSE` means do not display code warning in documentation. `sqrt(-1)` is not a valid calculation. The number places in side `sqrt()` cannot be negative. Therefore, if we want to calculate `sqrt(-1)`, it will return a NaN for us. Inside the first code chunk, it displays the warning message for us, because we set `warning = TRUE`. However, we implements `warning = FLASE` in the second code chunk. Therefore, it doesn't display any warning message. However, it doesm't influence the result of calculation. Both code chunks displys `NaN` as results of calculating. 

## Exercise D.10
```{r chunk1, eval = TRUE, include=TRUE}
x <- 15 
x
```

```{r chunk2}
x <- x+3
x 
```

```{r chunk1,eval=FALSE,include=TRUE}

```

`include` means include chunk in doc after running (default = TRUE). `eval` means Run code in chunk (default = TRUE). In the first code chunk (chunk1), `eval = TRUE` and `include = FALSE` mean run code chunk but do not inlude chunk in doc after running. Therefore, the variable x has been assigned with value 15. When we run the second code chunk, it grabs the value stored in x, which is 15, and adds 3 into x. Therefore, the result of x will be `18`.   

If we change the chunk1 with  `eval = FALSE` and `include = TRUE`. Then we will get an error `object x not found`. The reason is code chunk1 will not run if we change `eval` from `TRUE` to `FALSE`. Therefore, if we want to run code chunk2, the value stored in x will not be found. Then it will generate an error for us.  ?
